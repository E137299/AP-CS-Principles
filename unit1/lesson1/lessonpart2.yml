  ## Practice Coding Challenge: Swapping Two Words


  ### Instructions


  **Input Collection**


  * The program will receive a single string containing exactly two words
  separated by a single space.


  **String Manipulation**


  * Swap the positions of the two words.


  * Do not use any if-else statements or loops in your script.


  **Output**


  * Print the new string with the second word appearing first, followed by the
  first word.


  **Example**


  * For input `"hello world"`, the output should be `"world hello"`.


  ### Sample Code


  ```python

  # Sample input

  input_string = "hello world"


  # Splitting the input string into two words

  word1, word2 = input_string.split()


  # Swapping the words and printing the result

  output_string = f"{word2} {word1}"

  print(output_string)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `split()` method is used to divide the input string into two words.


  * The words are then swapped using formatted string literals (f-strings) to
  create the output string.


  * Finally, the result is printed, showing the words in reversed order.
